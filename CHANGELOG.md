 - `domino.EventDispatcher` is now prototyped
 - `request` now accept an array of objects as argument.
 - Unless the settings key `"mergeRequests"` is `false`, parallel requests are now "merged" to prevent parallel loops multiplication when:
   * the `request` method is called several time in the same callback (hack, success, etc...)
   * the `request` method is called with an array of services descriptions

#### 1.2.0 (February 18, 2013)

 - Added `expect` feature to filter successful service calls.
 - Added unit tests for services.
 - Added a sample with two instances communicating through a server emulated with [jquery.mockjax.js](https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax).

#### 1.1.1 (January 18, 2013)

 - Improved a bit environment.

 - Fixed shortcuts priority: custom objects > properties > shortcuts
 - `update(key, value)` now works
 - Added possibility to override any setting in each instance
 - Added possibility to override `clone` property for each property
 - Using `data` when calling a service now eventually overrides the function `data` in the service declaration
